# Contribute to Wireless Switch
:+1::+1:First I want to say thank you for spending your time to contribute to this project :+1::+1:

`NOTE:` Remember that this is a guidelines not a rule, you can follow or not to follow the guidelines. It goes back to you, but I recommended using the guidelines to make sure that other people know what you are doing to this project.

## 1. Creating Branches
Use this naming format when you are creating new branch `category-branch_focus`.

For example:
If you are creating a branch from `master` to add new theme to the GUI you should create a new branch called `art-guiThemeDark`.

## 2. Creating Issues
`NOTE:` When you want to ask some question, you might want to talk with me via email @ [dionrickysptr@gmail.com](mailto:dionrickysptr@gmail.com) since I respond to your email faster than to reply to your issues on GitHub.

* Give a short and simple title but clearly explain the issue.
* You might want to use some emoji to show the category of the issue for example ðŸŽ¨ is used as GUI styling enhancement.
* Add labels to describe the issue e.g. `bug` `enhancement`.
* Make sure your issue hasn't been issued yet. Search through the open and closed issue and make sure that you don't make a copy of it.
  * If I found a duplicate, I will close the issue and comment you the link of an older issue.
  * If the older issue had been closed, but then you found the same issue hasn't fixed yet, please contact me via [email](mailto:dionrickysptr@gmail.com).
  * Note that not all of the issue you send are accepted, especially for some `enhancement` and `styling` issue.
